Input validation needs to be implemented in the code (if num <= 0) throw an exception or a runtime_error indicating that the number should be positive.

# Collatz-Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture made in C++

The program implements the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the **3n + 1 problem**. 

Calculates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer, displays the highest number in the sequence, the amount of calculations and the time needed to make them.

# Usage
The program can be run through the executable (.exe) or by using a terminal with **'./collatz'**, with or without arguments.

Valid arguments are:  

Starting number (Must be positive).

Example: ./collatz 10

// Add a .exe and ./ example screenshots
